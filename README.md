# dibs-reu2018
To start this repo will have one of the benchmarks added, more will be added later. 

The first application is the tstcsv to csv (tstcsv) conversion which can be found in the serial folder. The program can be built using the command make, but you may need to modify the Makefile depending on your system. The input for the program can be found in the input folder under tstcsv. Use the csv file that is in the folder to run your tests, don't worry about the random generator for now.
